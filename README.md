# Basic Assembly Interpreter

This is my final project for course CS50x.

## Instructions
| Instruction | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `mov x, y*` | Copies the value of `y` into `x` |
| `inc x`     | Increments the value of `x` |
| `dec x`     | Decrements the value of `x` |
| `add x, y*` | Adds the value of `y` to `x` and stores it in `x` |
| `sub x, y*` | Substracts the value of `y` from `x`and stores it in `x` |
| `mul x, y*` | Multiplies `x` by the value of `y` and stores it in `x` |
| `div x, y*` | Divides `x` by the value of `y` and stores it in `x` |
| `cmp x, y*` | Compares `x` and `y`, see [conditions](#conditions) for more detail |
| `prnt x`    | Prints the value of `x` during runtime |
| `jmp lbl`   | Jumps to label `lbl` without a condition |
| `je lbl`    | Jumps to label `lbl`, if compare was equal |
| `jne lbl`   | Jumps to label `lbl`, if compare was not equal |
| `jg lbl`    | Jumps to label `lbl`, if compare was greater |
| `jge lbl`   | Jumps to label `lbl`, if compare was equal or greater |
| `jl lbl`    | Jumps to label `lbl`, if compare was less |
| `jle lbl`   | Jumps to label `lbl`, if compare was equal or less |
| `call lbl`  | Calls the subroutine `lbl`, see [subroutines](#subroutines) for more detail |
| `ret`       | Returns from the most recent subroutine |
| `end`       | Ends the program |
